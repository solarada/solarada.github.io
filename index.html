<h1>SolarPool [SOLAR]</h1>

<p>SolarPool is a Cardano stake pool project aiming to run on distributed power. The Cardano Proof of stake consensus mechanism makes this possible because electricity is not wasted as in Proof of work hashing. Green electricity can be obtained via power grid as well, but running your own supply means greater level of decentralization.
</p>

<p>It is slightly funny that SolarPool is located in northern Finland and may not be able to run on solar power all year round. Does it make sense then ? Yes. The power supply system will eliminate the need for a separate UPS and ideally with big enough panel and battery capacity the node could be run at least 90% on solar energy all year round. One of the reasons for this project is also providing information for the community about the system hardware choices, power consumption and the achieved overall performance.

<h2>Phase 0 (current)</h2>
<p>In the first phase of the project the node is executed with typical hardware.</p>

<h2>Phase 1</h2>
<p>Migrate the node to energy efficient hardware (Intel NUC)</p>

<h2>Phase 2</h2>
<p>Power supply from lead-acid battery bank. No inverter is necessary if Intel NUC or similar is used.</p>

<h2>Phase 3</h2>
<p>Installation of solar panels and charge controller.</p>

<h2>Phase 4</h2>
<p>Powering network gear from battery bank.</p>
